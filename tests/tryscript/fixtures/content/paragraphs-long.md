# Long Paragraphs

This is a paragraph that is right at the boundary of the default width setting. It has exactly enough text to test.

This is a very long paragraph that should definitely be wrapped at any reasonable width setting because it goes on and on and on with many words and phrases that make it extend well beyond the default eighty-eight character width limit that flowmark uses by default for line wrapping purposes in formatted output.

Short paragraph.

A paragraph with **bold text** and [a link](https://example.com) and some `inline code` mixed in with regular text that makes wrapping more interesting because of inline formatting.
