# flowmark

Flowmark is a new Python implementation of **text and Markdown line wrapping and
filling**, with an emphasis on making **git diffs** and **LLM edits** to text documents
easier to diff and review.

In addition, it adds **support for Markdown** and offers **Markdown auto-formatting and
normalization** as a library or from the command line.
This is much like [markdownfmt](https://github.com/shurcooL/markdownfmt) or
[prettier's Markdown support](https://prettier.io/blog/2017/11/07/1.8.0) but is pure
Python and has (in my humble opinion) better options and defaults.

## Installation

The simplest way to use the tool is to use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).
Then run `uvx flowmark --help`.

To install the command-line properly:

```shell
uv tool install flowmark
```

Or [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx):

```shell
pipx install flowmark
```

Then

```
flowmark --help
```

To use as a library, use uv/poetry/pip to install
[`flowmark`](https://pypi.org/project/flowmark/).

## Use in VSCode/Cursor

You can use Flowmark to auto-format Markdown on save in VSCode or Cursor.
Install the "Run on Save" (`emeraldwalk.runonsave`) extension.
Then add to your `settings.json`:

```json
  "emeraldwalk.runonsave": {
    "commands": [
        {
            "match": "\\.md$",
            "cmd": "flowmark --auto ${file}"
        }
    ]
  }
```

The `--auto` option is just the same as `--inplace --nobackup --semantic`.

## Use Cases

- As a **command line formatter** to format text or Markdown files using the `flowmark`
  command.

- To **autoformat Markdown on save in VSCode/Cursor** or any other editor that supports
  running a command on save.
  Flowmark uses a readable format that makes diffs easy to read and use on GitHub.
  It also normalizes all Markdown syntax variations (such as different header or
  formatting styles). This can be especially useful for documentation and editing
  workflows where clean diffs and minimal merge conflicts on GitHub are important.

- As a **library to autoformat Markdown**. For example, it is great to normalize the
  outputs from LLMs to be consistent, or to run on the inputs and outputs of LLM
  transformations that edit text, so that the resulting diffs are clean.
  Having this as a simple Python library makes this easy in AI-related document
  pipelines.

- As a **drop-in replacement library for Python's default
  [`textwrap`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/textwrap.html)** but with more options.
  It simplifies and generalizes that library, offering better control over **initial and
  subsequent indentation** and **when to split words and lines**, e.g. using a word
  splitter that won't break lines within HTML tags.

- Flowmark has the option to to use **semantic line breaks** (using a heuristic to break
  lines on sentences sentences when that is reasonable), which is an underrated feature
  that can **make diffs on GitHub much more readable**. The the change may seem subtle
  but avoids having paragraphs reflow for very small edits, which does a lot to
  **minimize merge conflicts**. An example of what sentence-guided wrapping looks like,
  see the
  [Markdown source](https://github.com/jlevy/flowmark/blob/main/README.md?plain=1) of
  this readme file.)

- Very, very simple and fast **regex-based sentence splitting**. This should work fine
  for English and many other latin/Cyrillic languages but it hasn't been tested on CJK.

It aims to be small and simple and have only a few dependencies, currently only
[`marko`](https://github.com/frostming/marko),
[`regex`](https://pypi.org/project/regex/), and
[`strif`](https://github.com/jlevy/strif).

Because **YAML frontmatter** is common on Markdown files, the Markdown autoformat
preserves all frontmatter (content between `---` delimiters at the front of a file).

## Why a New Markdown Formatter?

Previously I'd implemented something very similar with
[for Atom](https://github.com/jlevy/atom-flowmark).
I found the Markdown formatting conventions enforced by the that plugin worked really
well for editing and publishing large or collaboratively edited documents.

This is new, pure Python implementation.
There are numerous needs for a tool like this on the command line and in Python.

With LLM tools now using Markdown everywhere, there are enormous advantages to having
very clean and well-formatted Markdown documents, since you can then cleanly see diffs
or edits made by LLMs.

If you are in a workspace where you are editing lots of text, having them all be
Markdown with frontmatter, auto-formatted for every git commit makes for a *much* better
experience.

## Usage

Flowmark can be used as a library or as a CLI.

```
$ flowmark --help
usage: flowmark [-h] [-o OUTPUT] [-w WIDTH] [-p] [-s] [-i] [--nobackup] [file]

Flowmark: Better line wrapping and formatting for plaintext and Markdown

positional arguments:
  file                 Input file (use '-' for stdin)

options:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  -o, --output OUTPUT  Output file (use '-' for stdout)
  -w, --width WIDTH    Line width to wrap to
  -p, --plaintext      Process as plaintext (no Markdown parsing)
  -s, --semantic       Enable sentence-based line breaks (only applies to Markdown mode)
  -i, --inplace        Edit the file in place (ignores --output)
  --nobackup           Do not make a backup of the original file when using --inplace

Flowmark provides enhanced text wrapping capabilities with special handling for
Markdown content. It can:

- Format Markdown with proper line wrapping while preserving structure
  and normalizing Markdown formatting

- Optionally break lines at sentence boundaries for better diff readability

- Process plaintext with HTML-aware word splitting

It is both a library and a command-line tool.

Command-line usage examples:

  # Format a Markdown file to stdout
  flowmark README.md

  # Format a Markdown file and save to a new file
  flowmark README.md -o README_formatted.md

  # Edit a file in-place (with or without making a backup)
  flowmark --inplace README.md
  flowmark --inplace --nobackup README.md

  # Process plaintext instead of Markdown
  flowmark --plaintext text.txt

  # Use sentences to guide line breaks (good for many purposes git history and diffs)
  flowmark --semantic README.md
